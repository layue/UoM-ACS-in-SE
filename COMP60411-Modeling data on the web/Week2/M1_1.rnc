# RelaxNG supports only very simple datatype: text. If you want more complex ones, 
# you can 'import' them from XML Schema (another XML schema language) by including the following line: 
# 
#  datatypes xsd = "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-datatypes"
# 
# with this line, we could have written 
# 
#  int-description = element int { attribute value { xsd:integer }, empty }
# 
# and suitable validating parsers would have understood this, i.e., rejected elements like <int value="a"/>

#  Ints are empty elements. I use an attribute

#    <int>576</int>
#    <int value="572"/>
