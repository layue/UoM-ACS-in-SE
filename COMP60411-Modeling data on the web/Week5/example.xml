        <title value="Pushing the EL Envelope" />
        <abstract value="Recently, it has been shown that the small descrip- tion logic (DL) EL, which allows for conjunction and existential restrictions, has better algorithmic properties than its counterpart F L0 , which allows for conjunction and value restrictions. Whereas the subsumption problem in FL0 becomes already in- tractable in the presence of acyclic TBoxes, it re- mains tractable in EL even with general concept inclusion axioms (GCIs). On the one hand, we ex- tend the positive result for EL by identifying a set of expressive means that can be added to EL with- out sacrificing tractability. On the other hand, we show that basically all other additions of typical DL constructors to EL with GCIs make subsump- tion intractable, and in most cases even EXPTIME- complete. In addition, we show that subsumption in FL0 with GCIs is EXPTIME-complete." />

        <abstract value="The OWL Web Ontology Language is a new formal language for representing ontologies in the Semantic Web. OWL has features from several families of representation languages, including primarily Description Logics and frames. OWL also shares many characteristics with RDF, the W3C base of the Semantic Web. In this paper, we discuss how the philosophy and features of OWL can be traced back to these older formalisms, with modifications driven by several other constraints on OWL. Several interesting problems have arisen where these influences on OWL have clashed." />
